## Tokens

SageXAI uses **Bearer tokens** for all API calls. Create a Personal Access Token in the dashboard and include it in your `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

## Environments

- **Local**: `https://sagexai.com/`
- **Production**: `https://sagexai.com/api/` (replace with your deployment URL)

Keep tokens secret. We recommend storing credentials in a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) and injecting them at runtime.
