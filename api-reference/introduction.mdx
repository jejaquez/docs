## Overview

SageXAI exposes two core endpoints in the MVP:

- `POST /api/v1/guard` — scan prompts or model outputs for risky patterns
- `GET /api/v1/guard/results` — retrieve past scans for dashboards & analytics

### Authentication

Send a **Bearer token** in the `Authorization` header for every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>
```

See the <a href="/guides/authentication">Authentication guide</a> for environment details.
